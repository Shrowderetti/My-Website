         <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
         <p>Throughout my education, I have picked up many hobbies and explored various ideas for my career path. Here, I try to collect all my thoughts and ideas. Therefore, on this site, you will find my drawings, photos, 3D renders, and programming projects.</p>
         <p>I've always had an artistic side, which explains my interest in photography and drawing. With these passions in mind, I initially decided to enroll at the University of Warsaw to study Architecture. However, I soon realized that the major wasn't the right fit for me, so I decided to leave the program and search for something more fulfilling.</p>
         <p>Leaving Architecture allowed me to broaden my perspective and explore fields that had always intrigued me. That’s how I got into 3D design and a bit of programming. With these new interests, I decided to pursue another degree—this time focused on Computer Science, Graphic Design, and Web Development.</p>
         <p>Now, as I continue my studies, my main interest is definitely 3D art. A true dream come true would be the opportunity to work in Game Development, preferably as a 3D artist. However, any experience in that kind of working environment would be ideal.</p>

         <p class="project_text">Over the years, through both education and personal work, I have created a wide range of artworks that I’m rather proud of. Each piece reflects a part of my growth, curiosity, and passion for the craft, and I’m happy to show it off. </p>
